# SpaceInvaders-XNA

## Note: These are no the games source files, but are the game files needed to actually play it. 
## The software with which it was built (Microsoft's XNA Game Studio), is now deprecated and cannot even be installed on modern Windows. Therefore, the source files are lost.

Although the source files are lost to obsolesence, it is still possible to play the game by following these simple steps:

1. Install the **XNA Redistributable** location in the __GameRoot/Redistributable__ directory.
2. Launch the game with the SpaceInvaders.exe executable.
