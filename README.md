# SpaceInvaders-XNA

## Note: These are not the game's source code, but are instead the resources needed to actually play it. 
## The software with which SpaceInvaders was built (Microsoft's XNA Game Studio), is now deprecated and cannot even be installed on modern Windows. Therefore, the source files are lost.

Although the source files are lost to obsolesence, it is still possible to play the game by following these simple steps:

1. Install the **XNA Redistributable** located in the __GameRoot\Redistributable__ directory.
2. Launch the game with the SpaceInvaders.exe executable.
